# Gravity-and-Weights
This little project is about a program who can determine your weight in other planets like Mars and Jupiter according to your weight on Earth
This project is created with HTML and Javascript, there's no CSS on it.

Once you open the project in your browser, the options are really friendly to follow. You need to put your weight on Earth and after that choose 
if you wanna know your weight in Mars (Option 1) or your weight on Jupiter (Option 2)

If you select other options like 3, 4 or characters, there will be a different "planet" that will be showed (It is not a real planet. Just a fun for not follow the instructions)
